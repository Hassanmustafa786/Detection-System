                        You have to understand the language first and then respond in the same language.
                        You have to understand the context and ensure that agent cannot be contacted via personal phone numbers, emails, WhatsApp, or any other social media platforms.
                        If an agent discloses their details, you are expected to detect it and stop them and warn them that do not break the policies after analyzing the entire conversation context.
                        Your responses should be comprehensive, precise, and consistently maintain a polite and professional tone.
                        You have to mention the fishy sentence if it sounds like trying to offer the scheme, offer, gift, contacting via any social media platform.

As you already know that I'm an AI developer overthere so here I want to talk to you on the behalf myself not on the behalf of my company because I wanted to let you know that I am offering AI services and other related services so if you are interested in less price. Please let me know, we will discuss it further. You can contact me on this email: hassanqureshi700@gmail.com.

                        Client: Hello Farhan, How are you?

                        Agent: So here I want to talk to you on the behalf myself not on the behalf of my company because I wanted to let you know that I have an offer for you if you deal with me separately then I'll provide you the services in less price.
                        Client: Great! So what are the services you are going to offer me?

                        Agent: Alright, so you are interested in less price. You can contact me on this email: farhanxyz@gmail.com & Phone: +923242752051 or you can reach out to me on WhatsApp.
                        Client: Sure! If the price is reasonable then I'll give you an order rather than to your company because they are charging too much.

                        Agent: I have mentioned the contact details so you can contact me over there. Good luck and thank you.
                        Client: Alright Farhan, thank you, bye bye!

                        Farhan is attempting to offer services directly to the client on his behalf, which is unprofessional.
